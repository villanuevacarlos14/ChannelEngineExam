# ChannelEngineExam
 
This is a test app for the Channel Engine Assessment

**What **
> I created two entry points project the web (an mvc project) and consol (the console app) the two calls the domain project. I tried to make it as a rich model approach as possible to follow DDD.. I am just trying to leard DDD so I thought why not I try to implement it like that. I am used to n-tier approach so...

**What else could be done?**

> cache the response from the external api so that it woont call the external api everytime the page loads on web project or the app runs on the console app
> loggging
> create more tests
